# The Arms Control Watch — Open-Source Arms Transfers Map (2000–2024)

**Project lead:** Rowan Seipp  
**Contact:** armscontrolwatch@gmail.com  

This website is an interactive visualization of international arms transfers from **2000–2024**.

## What you can do here
- Explore arms transfer flows by year on an interactive world map
- View a country as an **exporter**, **importer**, or **both**
- Click countries to see partners and transfer details for the selected year

## About the values (TIV)
Values shown use SIPRI’s **Trend-Indicator Value (TIV)**. A TIV is **not a financial price**; it is a standardized indicator designed to compare the relative volume/significance of transfers across countries and over time.

SIPRI methodology: https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers/sources-and-methods

## Interpretation tip
- **As exporter** = flows **from** the selected country to partners  
- **As importer** = flows **to** the selected country from partners  
- **Both** = all flows involving the selected country  

## Notes & limitations
This tool is designed for transparency and education. Visual patterns can be misread without context—please consult SIPRI’s methods and avoid treating TIV as monetary value.
